# Team Formation With Status
This project is relative to the online social networks field. More specifically, from a given network of people with status relations between them (which suggest that someone is respecting someone's else status on the network), we proposed an algorithm in order to form a team. In such a team, except of the respect on the status theory between the team members, the team members cover a predefined set of skills. Also we make experimental evaluation of different networks using our proposed algorithm.

#### This project contains 
+ A report in which we make a clearer definition of the problem and propose our algorithm to solve this. Furthermore in this report we present the results from an experimental evaluation of our proposed algorithm on different social networks along with some thoughts about future work.
+ A very simple implementation of our proposed algorithm in Python using Jupyter Notebook.
+ The datasets we used as input for the experimental evaluation of the algorithm.

The whole project developed during the graduate course **Online Social Networks and Media** of [Dept. Computer Science & Engineering, UoI](http://cse.uoi.gr/en/)
